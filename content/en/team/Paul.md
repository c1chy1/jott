description: My name is Paul and I have been fascinated by computers since my youth. From the Commodore 64 to the Amiga and the PC, I have learnt to use these technologies all my life, even in times without the Internet. I completed my engineering degree in Wroclaw and a few years later I started to familiarise myself with the development of web applications. Sport has been with me all my life. I danced breakdance for several years and am currently active in calisthenics. I bring this variety of interests and skills to my work at JOTT.MEDIA.
