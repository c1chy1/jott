description: I am Inke and have been working in accounting and back office for over 30 years. My professional career began as a tax consultant assistant, and since then numbers have been my constant companion. Already during my school years, when set theory was taught, I knew that numbers had a special meaning for me. I am a big Denmark fan and bring my love for structure and organization into every project. At JOTT.MEDIA, I ensure that everything runs smoothly in the background so that our team can focus on creative and technical tasks."
