description: With 13 years of professional experience in the graphics department of an association and a solid education as a design assistant and industrial clerk, I have extensive expertise. I am characterised by my reliability, creativity and empathetic nature. I am valued for my sensitivity, honesty and helpfulness, which I demonstrate both in my work and in my personal dealings. In my spare time, I enjoy painting and ‘tinkering’ in my basement workshop, attending concerts, watching films, gardening and spending quality time with my family.
