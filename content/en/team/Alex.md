  I'm Alex and I started my first full-time job as Head of Content at a start-up in the education sector during my studies. In addition to a lot of practical experience, I was able to learn two things in particular: it is incredibly rewarding to create something new, and good solutions require not only creativity, but also methodology, determination and commitment. Through courses and studies, I specialised in UI/UX design and have now been active in this field for 5 years. At JOTT.MEDIA I use my experience and knowledge to develop user-friendly and innovative designs.
