description: My name is Arian and I have been fascinated by the world of technology since I was young. I completed my training as an IT specialist in Hanover and since then I have been intensively involved in the development and programming of applications, IoT systems and Raspberry Pi. Developing intelligent solutions and programming innovative applications is my passion. My drive is the deep understanding and beauty of the intellect, because I firmly believe that ‘there is no better beauty than the intellect’. At JOTT.MEDIA, I use my knowledge to drive forward pioneering projects and master technical challenges.
