description: My name is Jan and I am the creative head and managing director of JOTT.MEDIA. After training as a media specialist and gaining Figma certification, I worked in the newspaper industry for 15 years before specialising in the design of digital processes. My passion lies in UI/UX design, where I combine my creativity and technical knowledge to create user-friendly and appealing designs. In my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, which provides me with balance and inspiration for my work. ‘My courage to change and thus to be able to use our competences in a complementary way was the best decision of my life.’ This attitude characterises my work and my commitment to JOTT.MEDIA.
