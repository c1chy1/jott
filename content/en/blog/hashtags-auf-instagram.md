## **What do hashtags do?**

First and foremost, hashtags bring reach. On Instagram, they function like a signpost for your target group. They
help others discover your Instagram profile and get an impression of who you are and what your brand is all about.
brand is all about. By using the right hashtags for your posts on Instagram, you will appear more frequently in
the feeds of potential customers and users who are interested in similar content.

If you are interested in a specific topic, you can follow a hashtag - for example #jottmedia.

## **What exactly is an Instagram hashtag?**

A hashtag is characterised by a hashtag symbol (#) immediately before a single keyword or phrase.
It is also known as a number sign or hash. This symbol signals Instagram to link the following
to link the following text. This link ensures that you can be found on Instagram. Basically, any word
can be a hashtag.

## **Where are hashtags displayed?**

Firstly, of course, in Instagram posts. Here you can insert your hashtags at the bottom of the captions, the same
applies to
Instagram reels. If you click on the hashtag, you will land on an overview page in both cases. You can add hashtags
in your story as well.

## **How many hashtags should I use?**

Less is more. Instagram limits the number of hashtags per post to 30, but who wants an
unsightly ‘hashtag wall’ at the end of the caption?

Instagram itself recommends using between 3 and 5 hashtags per post. A new feature is currently being tested
is currently being tested that limits hashtags to 5. Maybe that's not such a bad thing, because it forces you to
to focus on the right hashtags. So it's quality over quantity that counts here.

There are a few other things you should pay attention to in order to use hashtags correctly:

1. there should be no space between the hashtag and the text, just like between individual words (wrong:# jott media
   or # jottmedia, **correct: #jottmedia**)
2. do not use any special characters (wrong: #jott.media or #jottmedia!)
3. numbers are allowed

## **A few more tips for use:**

- the content is always more important than the hashtags
- only use hashtags that fit your content (no wild selection just because they fit your account,
  but think specifically about which hashtags fit your content)
- Company names or brand names as hashtags: first ask yourself the following questions: Is your brand/company already
  known?
  Is it an added value for the user to use this hashtag? Then it is definitely worth using this hashtag.
- You theoretically have the option of inserting hashtags in the middle of the text, but #this makes the #text
  #difficult to read. It's better to bundle them at the end of your post.
- Write hashtags in the first comment under your post.

## **Include hashtags in Instagram Stories**

- Minimise your hashtags after writing and drag them to the bottom of the screen. They will then be hidden under the
  hidden under the frame. Just make sure you don't accidentally throw them in the bin!
- Minimise your hashtags and cover them with a sticker. Animated stickers make your story stand out from the crowd
  and cover up the hashtag clutter.
- Make your hashtags invisible with the pipette by color-matching the hashtag text to a plain background.
  to a solid color background.

## **Last but not least: Create a hashtag collection**

To avoid having to re-enter your relevant hashtags every time, you should save your core hashtags,
so that you only have to copy and paste them under your post.
