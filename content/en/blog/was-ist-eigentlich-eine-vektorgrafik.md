  “We need a vector graphic of the logo!“ Many people have certainly heard this sentence before when they want to work with a service provider. But what exactly is a vector graphic? This blog article is about what a vector graphic is and what it is needed for. First things first: it's not enough to rename your Logo.png file to Logo.svg or Logo.eps - too bad, but first things first.

## **What actually is a vector graphic?**

Vector graphics are ‘images’ that are defined by mathematical calculations and are not made up of individual(
pixels), like raster graphics. All objects in the image are described using coordinates, sizes and
thicknesses.

This means that vector graphics remain very flexible and can also be scaled afterwards without loss of quality,
regardless of the size in which they are required.
in whichever size they are required.

## **Vector graphic vs. pixel image**

Everyone is familiar with pixel images, every photo taken with a smartphone is a pixel image, and this is where the
strongest advantage. Pixel images are unbeatable when it comes to detailed graphics and textures, photorealistic
representation.
realistic representation. They are also super easy to handle and create. However, if you enlarge such an image too
much, it becomes grainy and blurred. Many people then say: pixelated.

To avoid pixelated images, vector-based work is perfect. Due to the special creation
of these images, they can then be scaled throughout the entire design process without any loss of quality.
loss of quality.

Which type I choose, however, depends very much on what I want to depict and for which area of application
I create the file.

## **When do I use vector-based graphics?

The respective use of the file ultimately determines which type we choose.

If I am designing a company logo, vector-based work is naturally the best choice. This means that the logo can be
can be scaled without loss at any time during the entire design process and displayed in the desired size on various
media
whether on the web or on a lorry tarpaulin.

However, if you want to create very detailed images that have a photorealistic character, then raster graphics are the
better choice.
Raster graphics are the better method.

Here is a list of the most common pixel file formats:

- JPG
- TIFF
- PNG
- WebP

## **Which file formats can contain vector graphics at all?**

Here is a list of the classics, without any claim to completeness.

- AI
- EPS
- PDF
- SVG

If one of these files is present, however, it is only an indication that it could be a vector graphic.
This is because all of these file formats can contain both pixel and vector data, even in combination.

However, if I receive a pure logo as AI or EPS, there is a high probability that it is a vector-based file.
vector-based file.

You can test this by enlarging the file considerably and taking a look at the edge smoothing. If
If small ‘staircase effects’ appear on curves or lines and the image becomes blurred, then it is definitely a pixel
file.

However, if all lines and curves remain ‘sharp’ and the quality does not suffer from the high magnification,
it is a vector file.

To summarize, both file types have their advantages and disadvantages. Which
type is the right one depends on the intended use and what I want to depict.

Basically anyone can create a pixel image, but with vector graphics it is more difficult and I need suitable software
that is more suited to professional use.
I need suitable software, which is more likely to be found in the professional sector, but some free tools also enable
the
creation in the meantime.
